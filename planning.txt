CODING ALONG WITH KEY - notes

GOAL: do this assn by myself !!!! 

//client.js make sure it is ready - ensure it is 'onReady'
$(document).ready(onReady); 
-- this is important for our 'loop'

1. create an onReady() function -
 - inside we need a loop that will go over the entire 'employee' array/objct list
 FOR LOOP ++> for (let employee of employees) {
 }
- need to loop over each employee 

2. break down code aka DE-COUPLING 


****** INSIDE THE calculateIndividualEmployeeBonus function: 

3. Conditional statements for these: 
-***  Set a variable to hold these Conditional statements *** AKA let bonusPercentage; 
- Those who have a rating of a 2 or below should not receive a bonus.
- Those who have a rating of a 3 should receive a base bonus of 4% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 4 should receive a base bonus of 6% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 5 should receive a base bonus of 10% of their base annual income.
** handle/catches ERROR or out of norm situation with the else / defaul == if not any of the about then default to this

4. write another set of Conditional statements for these special cases: 
- If their employee number is 4 digits long, this means they have been with the company for longer than 15 years,
  and should receive an additional 5%. (example: bonusPercentage += 5;)

5. write another set of Conditional statements for this:
- However, if their annual income is greater than $65,000, they should have their bonus adjusted down 1%.
example: bonusPercentage -= 1;

6. write another set of Conditional statements for this: MIN 0%
- referring to: No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total. 

6. write another set of Conditional statements for this: MAX 13% 
- referring to: No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total. 

7. create a variable 'totalBonus'; to get the total bonusPercentage you need:
a. employee's annualSalary 
b. bonusPercentage / 100 (this take the integers and turn into decimals)

8. create another variable 'totalCompensation' by taking the totalBonus adding with employee's annualSalary
- remember to use Number() method! to convert the annualSalary string to Number instead!
