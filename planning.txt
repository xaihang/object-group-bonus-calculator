NOTES: break down code aka DE-COUPLING 



1. create a function -
 - inside we need a loop that will go over the entire 'employee' array/objct list
 FOR LOOP ++> for (let employee of employees) {
 }
- need to loop over each employee 

const employeeObject = function (array) {
  for (let employee of employees) {
    console.log( `Name: ${employee.name}`); // looping through each employee
  }
}
employeeObject(employees); 



****** INSIDE THE calculateIndividualEmployeeBonus function: 

2. Conditional statements for these: 
-***  Set a variable to hold these Conditional statements *** AKA let bonusPercentage; 
- Those who have a rating of a 2 or below should not receive a bonus.
- Those who have a rating of a 3 should receive a base bonus of 4% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 4 should receive a base bonus of 6% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 5 should receive a base bonus of 10% of their base annual income.
** handle/catches ERROR or out of norm situation with the else / default == if not any of the about then default to this

let bonusPercentage; 
if(reviewRating <= 2 ) {
     bonusPercentage = 0;
} else if(reviewRating === 3) {
     bonusPercentage = 4;
} else if(reviewRating === 4) {
     bonusPercentage = 6;
} else if (reviewRating === 5) {
     bonusPercentage = 10; 
} else {
    console.log('Employee reviewRating does not match any criteria above!');
}

3. write another set of Conditional statements for these special cases: 
- If their employee number is 4 digits long, this means they have been with the company for longer than 15 years,
  and should receive an additional 5%. (example: bonusPercentage += 5;)




4. write another set of Conditional statements for this:
    - However, if their annual income is greater than $65,000, they should have their bonus adjusted down 1%.
    example: bonusPercentage -= 1;

5. write another set of Conditional statements for this: MIN 0%
    - referring to: No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total. 

6. write another set of Conditional statements for this: MAX 13% 
    - referring to: No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total. 

7. create a variable 'totalBonus'; to get the total bonusPercentage you need:
    a. employee's annualSalary 
    b. bonusPercentage / 100 (this take the integers and turn into decimals)

8. create another variable 'totalCompensation' by taking the totalBonus adding with employee's annualSalary
    - remember to use Number() method! to convert the annualSalary string to Number instead!







//setup jquery stuff = for the BONUS// 

//client.js make sure it is ready - ensure it is 'onReady'
$(document).ready(onReady); 
-- this is important for our 'loop'
