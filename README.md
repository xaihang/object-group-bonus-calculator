# Bonus Calculator App

You are going to write a single JavaScript file to automatically calculate employee bonus for a company.

## Objectives

- Practice Read, Write, Speak, Teach skills
- Solidify JavaScript knowledge
- Translate business needs to code
- Practice Group Work

## Pair Programming

We'll be pair/trio programming for our first group coding activity.

> Note: This is a real world thing, not just a thing kids do or that we use in the classroom. Many people use pair programming on the job.

For **remote work**, use [VSCode Live Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/vscode) to collaborate on code in pairs.

Key takeaways:
- Use 1 computer for coding. First driver uses the template.  Others can fork from the 1st driver when done so everyone gets the code.
- Communicate - It should not be quiet in here.
- Switch roles - one person should not drive for the whole assignment.

## Where to Start

This project can seem huge. It is an exercise in figuring out where to start and what SMALL STEPS to take next.

It's often a good idea to "make it work for one thing" before making it work for all the things. In this case, we could work on getting the bonus calculation function working for just one employee before trying to call it multiple times inside of a loop. 

Consider starting by getting this function to work only for Atticus.


## Data Structure

The company is providing you with a few samples of employee data of how their data is currently being stored. Each are stored in a global array named `employees`.

### Employee Array 
Each **Employee** currently is configured in this way:

* The `name` property holds the employee's name.
* The `employeeNumber` property has their employee number.
* The `annualSalary` property contains their base annual salary.
* The `reviewRating` property contains their review rating.


## A Loop to Process Bonuses

Loop over the `employees` array and do the following:

* use each employee object as the input to the function described below.
* `console.log` the results of each iteration.
    - The `log` should be in the loop, not the function.

## The Bonus Calculation Function

Write a declared function that takes in one **Employee** object (as an argument to the function), and `return` a new **object** with the following properties. _Note these properties are different than the ones you start with!_

* The `name` property should contain the employee's name.
* The `bonusPercentage` property should contain the bonus percentage the employee is to receive. See section below for calculation instructions.
* The `totalCompensation` property should be the adjusted annual compensation (base annual + bonus)
* The `totalBonus` should be the employee's total bonus rounded to the nearest dollar.

`${name} ${bonusPercentage} ${totalCompensation} ${totalBonus}`

### Individual Bonus Rules

- Those who have a rating of a 2 or below should not receive a bonus.
- Those who have a rating of a 3 should receive a base bonus of 4% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 4 should receive a base bonus of 6% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 5 should receive a base bonus of 10% of their base annual income.
- If their employee number is 4 digits long, this means they have been with the company for longer than 15 years,
and should receive an additional 5%.
- However, if their annual income is greater than $65,000, they should have their bonus adjusted down 1%.
- No bonus can be above 13% or below 0% total.

## Stretch Goals
- Put the output on the DOM (visually on the page).
- Make the app run only after the user clicks on a button on the page
- Then style the output, making it visually appealing.
